# Seq ToDo

1. Ensure c programs are compiled when package is installed.
2. include instructions about getting kch
3. build additional genomes (finish mm10)
4. fix t/gene.t test to remove dependencies on kch files
  - ideally build a mini genome as part of the build process
  - select a small gene track like CCDS or refGene
