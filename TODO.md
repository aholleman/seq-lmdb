# Seq ToDo

1. Ensure c programs are compiled when package is installed.
2. include instructions about getting kch
3. build additional genomes (finish mm10)
4. add this to testing
  - ideally build a mini genome as part of the build process
  - select a small gene track like CCDS or refGene
5. for conservation tracks - check the needed files are present before 
  the build starts (i.e., command is submitted).
