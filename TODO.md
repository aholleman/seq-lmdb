# Seq ToDo

1. attribute `snp_id` to the appropriate db it came from - e.g., clinvar 
   versus snp141.
2. ensure phastcons and phylop are created and read in the same way - round 
   trip integrity.
3. more tests
4. build non-human assemblies
5. integrate statistics calculators
6. integrate cadd scores for hg38 and hg19
