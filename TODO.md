# todo
1. enhancements to read_genome.pl and read_genome_with_dbs.pl
    - listed in preamble of both programs
2. finish work on Seq.pm
    - seralize data
    - write to CSV
3. the yaml file has a subtle bug since the directories are all relative to
    some base directory. Either a base directory is specified or passed in
    as a command line parameter. ConfigFromFile could accept either approach.
